## Peer Mentorship

It’s the elephant in the room: everyone is coming into bootcamp with varying skill levels and experiences. Some of you have studied coding before while others have a wide range of life experience in a diversity of industries, fields, and realms. Regardless of your current skill level, it is _absolutely indisputable_ that if you were accepted into this program, you have something to contribute to Vrbo and the greater developer community.

### When You’re Ahead

So you’re ahead, eh? While it may be tempting to forge on ahead with barely a thought about your peers, remember to drop them a line on Slack! Let them know what parts you got tripped up on, and offer to help out if someone gets stuck on the same thing that you did. When the time comes to be a peer mentor, you will not only reinforce the lessons that you struggled with earlier, but you will start to develop the skill to articulate technical concepts. To teach is to learn twice over.

### How do I Peer Mentor?

Step one is to help your peer understand the problem that they are wanting to solve. Some of that might be figuring out how close they are to a solution. Sometimes that means pseudocoding out a solution to the problem. Write out in plain language how you, as a human being, would solve the problem. Then, highlight or circle words that map to programming keywords (ex: if, each, equals, etc). Follow that up by encouraging them to translate the rest of the language into code. 

You may also want to consider if there is a hint or function you can suggest that will unlock the challenge that your peer is having to help them to move forward.

### Unanticipated Benefits

If you’re still not convinced, think about it this way: the more you collaborate with your peers, the more proficient you become with talking through problems, explaining solutions, and verbalizing your approach -- all key skills when it comes to acing technical interviews and being a coding lead.

## Goal

In this activity you're going to practice working with command line arguments and looping by solving another string manipulation problem.

## Problem

Write a program that takes any number of command line arguments, all strings, and reverses them before outputting them one at a time to the console.

Do NOT use JavaScript's [Array.prototype.reverse](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reverse) or [Array.prototype.join](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/join) functions to solve this problem.

Assuming the program is named `reverse.js`, the following are a few example runs.

```terminal
node reverse.js hello goodbye
olleh
eybdoog
```

```terminal
node reverse.js 1 fish 2 fish
1
hsif
2
hsif
```

## A Collaborative Learning Environment

You may have walked into class today thinking that bootcamp is a solitary and independant endeavour; a personal challenge that only you can conquer through the strength of your own will.

Let me stop you right there!

This is one of the common misconceptions of bootcamp: that you must do it alone. On the contrary, this will be one of the most collaborative learning environments that you will ever experience. Not only do we want you to work together, we _expect_ you to work together. Bootcamp isn’t just about taking another class. It’s about mimicking a junior developer team.

I have seen that cohorts who help each other and collaborate effectively come out on top, pushing each other forward and elevating the skills of the entire group. Graduating with strong colleagues will benefit Vrbo in the long term, as your class mates will become the core members of on teams you will work with moving forward.

"One Team" is one of our core philosophies. When we share knowledge, everyone benefits and the group succeeds. This reading will teach you how to effectively collaborate with your teams and partners.

## Pair Programming

Often times, developers are seen as secluded individuals who work alone. This isn’t the most efficient way of doing things, and can often lead to poor practice. We want to expose you to different practices in the industry, and one of them is pair programming.

### What is pair programming?

Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the Driver, writes code while the other, the Navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently.

While reviewing, the Navigator also considers the "strategic" direction of the work, coming up with ideas for improvements and likely future problems to address. This frees the Driver to focus all of their attention on the "tactical" aspects of completing the current task, using the observer as a safety net and guide.

### How to Pair Program

The biggest pitfall developers face is incorrect form. It has been a common observation that people who are assigned to pair program are on seperate computers, both coding their own solutions while utilizing their partner for questions and confirmation. While this is one way to program, it is not pair programming at all. The proper described way is to have two developers working at the _same_ computer, with one acting as the Driver (writing the code) and one acting as the Navigator (pitching ideas, confirming syntax, looking things up, and giving the Driver instructions and ideas).

### Why Pair Program?

1. Approach<br>
One of the most common issues that will plague a student in the initial week of bootcamp is trying to write code to solve a problem, and not knowing where to start. Quite often, the challenge is knowing that there are many possible solutions and not knowing which one to pick. Your Driver or Navigator can be an immensely-valuable asset in talking through the approach to a problem. They’re like your rubber duck, but for planning a solution instead of solving a bug!
2. Having a Navigator eases the workload<br>
A common issue that new developers often run into is looking for syntax or language-specific methods. Not only do you have to write code, but you _also_ have to figure out how to write it syntactically correct. As you may have seen, JavaScript has a lot of syntax, so having a Navigator makes this process more manageable!
3. Confidence and Affirmation<br>
How many times have you tried something new and felt more confident after your peer affirmed that you were doing it well? The same thing can apply to programming. When you pair program, you will feel like you are doing things wrong or that the methods you want to use are not good. However, your partner will be able to help confirm your decisions, so that you can both move more confidently in the right direction.
4. Code Quality<br>
Pair programming increases code quality by having two programmers sharing viewpoints and ideas, which helps bring clear ideas and direction to the table and allows for better coverage in knowledge. The risk of error goes down, more research is done, better syntax is used, and more care will be taken with what is written. You are able to transfer your skills to each other, and confirm or correct existing knowledge on the spot.
5. Verbalizing Your Thoughts<br>
The ability to communicate what you’re thinking is a learned skill that will help you in the real world when it comes to technical interviews and working on a dev team. Pairing will force you to take the gibberish in your head and form it into a logical approach. This will be tough at first, but it will come more easily the more you practice it.
6. Waste Less Time<br>
Let your partner save you from the rabbit holes that beckon. Not only are they your coding pair; they are your reality check too!

### Common Pitfalls, and How to Avoid Them

1. Ego<br>
A big issue that can occur is when one programmer feels superior to the other. This is a common mistake to make as it bars the ability to learn. It is important to come into pair programming with an open mind and to take into consideration what the other person has to offer. Never assume that there is nothing to learn from your partner as it is highly valuable to take their knowledge into account, even if they are less experienced. The best programmers are good listeners and two heads are always better than one.
2. Imposter Syndrome<br>
On the other side of the coin, do not let it faze you if your pair seemingly knows more than you! It’s almost guaranteed that you will not be perfectly balanced at _every_ given moment. One person will naturally have a better grasp on what the assignment is asking, or the concepts at play… or they may just be more awake and focused. Do not let this throw you off! It’s likely that this dynamic will switch back and forth throughout the day, and keep in mind that your pair is still benefiting from having you as their Driver or Navigator.
3. Competition<br>
Treat the final product as a shared creation. No one will ask you who did which part, so there’s no point in keeping track. The point here is to learn from each other and work towards a common goal.
4. Blame<br>
Trust your partner! If things go wrong, there's always a way to fix it. Start with small steps and move towards the larger idea rather than throw more code when it's broken.
5. Working Together, But Alone...<br>
I see a lot of people "pair programming" by working on their own computers and using each other for questions. Wrong! Pick one person to be the Driver, one person to be the Navigator, and sit beside one another. If you are the navigator, close your text editor and keep MDN or Google handy. If you are the driver, try to program "out loud". Discuss your ideas and why you are writing what you are writing. If you're confused, just ask! If you're certain, explain. The idea is to learn from your partner, and teach them what you know.


#### Now get to work!

You will be paired up with a fellow student for each day this week and the two of you will Pair Program all of the activities, except for quizzes. To the best of our ability, we will be pairing you with someone at a similar level to you. So make sure both of you are properly submitting your assignments.

Pairs will be released every morning on Slack. Pairing is mandatory until 4PM, at which point you are free to finish the remainder of the day solo.

*If you are the Driver*: you are the primary person coding. Remember that it is extremely important that you are talking about your code as you write it. This allows your Navigator to follow along.

*If you are the Navigator*: you have your laptop open too, but your code editor is closed and you have Google and MDN open. You are providing feedback, reviewing each line of code for errors, and considering the strategic direction of the work.

Please keep the following in mind:

- Switch the driver every 15 to 30 minutes so that both sides get equal time on the keyboard. Set a timer if that helps.
- Alternate who will request mentor assistance so that it does not appear that only one of you is requesting assistance.
- You will need to submit the code individually that there is a record of you both completing each exercise. Feel free to share the code you both worked on as a snippet in Slack. .
- As mentioned above, please take the quizzes individually and do not collaborate on answers.

Good luck!

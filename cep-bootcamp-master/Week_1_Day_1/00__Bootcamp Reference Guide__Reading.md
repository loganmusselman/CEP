## Goal

To set expectations. Please read this in full. Believe me, it's quite important.

### Course goal: Learn to think like a developer.

Our main goal for the this program is to get you to a point where you can think like a developer and continue to learn as you work. The program isn’t designed to teach you everything you need to know to become an expert (that takes years of practice). It’s designed to teach you how to approach problem solving, so you are successful and able to contribute in your first role.

### Some general things to keep in mind throughout the course:

Be comfortable being uncomfortable.

When you are tired / frustrated / stressed, remember that the program is designed to:

* Get you ready for a career in engineering.
* Help you develop and improve your grit.
* Encourage you to use online tools (i.e. Google, StackOverflow, etc.) to help you solve problems independently.

Ask for help! If you want or need something (assistance, code reviews, ad-hoc breakouts, etc.), ask for it! If you are having a problem, come talk to to me or a mentor!

### The 20/80 rule:

Your success is 20% determined by the program and 80% determined by you. While we provide the structure and guidance, only you can do certain things that are necessary for you to succeed in the program. Put in the hours and hard work, as your outcome will be determined by the effort you put in. Learning is an active process.

### Imposter Syndrome:

Did you know there's a well-documented phenomenon in which highly qualified people go through life feeling like they're a bunch of frauds and don't deserve the things they've achieved? It's very common for students to feel that way during bootcamp, if it gets overwhelming please come talk to one of us!

### Send us your feedback!

I <3 <3 <3 feedback and try my best to act on it! I  try to be as transparent as possible and am happy to explain why I structured aspects of the course the way I did. Our intructional team will be giving you lots of feedback throughout your learning, so it’s only fair that you get to give me some as well :)

### Assessment 

We evaluate students through tech interviews, code reviews, assignment submissions, quiz submissions and mentor feedback. Finish and turn in as much of the workload as you can.

### Request assistance!

Our mentors are here to support and guide you, take full advantage of their support! Mentors can be used to review your code, and offer suggestions on how to improve. This is a great way to push yourself further in the course.

**15 Minute Rule:** If you struggle through a problem for more than 15 minutes, please ask for help!
